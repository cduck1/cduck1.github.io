  <h3><u>Hide and Seek</u></h3>
<p><em>Call out. Call loud: ‘I’m ready! Come and find me!’<br>
The sacks in the toolshed smell like the seaside.<br>
They’ll never find you in this salty dark,<br>
But be careful that your feet aren’t sticking out.<br>
Wiser not to risk another shout.<br>
The floor is cold. They’ll probably be searching<br>
The bushes near the swing. Whatever happens<br>
You mustn’t sneeze when they come prowling in.<br>
And here they are, whispering at the door;<br>
You’ve never heard them sound so hushed before.<br>
Don’t breathe. Don’t move. Stay dumb. Hide in your blindness.<br>
They’re moving closer, someone stumbles, mutters;<br>
Their words and laughter scuffle, and they’re gone.<br>
But don’t come out just yet; they’ll try the lane<br>
And then the greenhouse and back here again.<br>
They must be thinking that you’re very clever,<br>
Getting more puzzled as they search all over.<br>
It seems a long time since they went away.<br>
Your legs are stiff, the cold bites through your coat;<br>
The dark damp smell of sand moves in your throat.<br>
It’s time to let them know that you’re the winner.<br>
Push off the sacks. Uncurl and stretch. That’s better!<br>
Out of the shed and call to them: ‘I’ve won!<br>
Here I am! Come and own up I’ve caught you!’<br>
The darkening garden watches. Nothing stirs.<br>
The bushes hold their breath; the sun is gone.<br>
Yes, here you are. But where are they who sought you?</em></p>

<p>This is one of my favorite poems due to the dark insights that it can give you about Vernon Scannell's view of the world post childhood. A full, <a href="https://genius.com/Vernon-scannell-hide-and-seek-annotated">line-by-line breakdown of the poem</a> is necessary to really understand and appreciate it. A brief explanation: The poem focuses on a young child playing hide and seek with friends. At first the child is full of joy and excitement but is naive as he does not seem to understand the rules of the game and comforts himself by speaking to himself, talking himself through the process slowly. His friends coming predatorially "prowling" around him as he seems to be growing up in his hiding places - the greenhouse and "that salty dark", his naiety to the fact that his friends have already found him results in him being mocked and made fun off. They then leave his alone and wondering in a reality which is much darker than it seemed, even nature seems to have collued in his betrayal.</p>
