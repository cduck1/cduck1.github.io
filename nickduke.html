<h1>Happy Birthday Nick Duke!</h1>
<p>Hi dad, happy 50th birthday! I made you a website to celebrate, I hope you like it! I'm not exactly to sure what to fill it up with, but tell me and I will code it in.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to see <a href = "https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-people-named-nick/reference">other famous people named Nick</a>, although you might overtake them with this website?</p>
<p>Maybe you want to see <a href = "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/may-16th.php">other famous people with the same birthday as you?</a></p>
<p>Maybe you wanted to see a virtual safari tour, as was intended before coronavirus - but hold on with this one, I think there is something waiting for you later today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of <a href = "https://explore.org/livecams/grace-gorillas/gorilla-forest-corridor">Gorrilla's sunbathing in thick jungle?</a></li>
<li>Of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2oSZfsWHyE&feature=emb_title">an afternoon tour shot in the Ngala Private Game Reserve</a>on the 30th of April?</li>
<li>Of <a href = "https://explore.org/livecams/african-wildlife/tembe-elephant-park">the Tembe Elephant Park in Emangusi, South Africa?</a> Not much going on there right now, but the noise of the surrounding environment is still pretty impressive.</li>
<li>Or you could <a href = "https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/how-to-do-a-virtual-safari-a4411406.html">choose your own!</a>
